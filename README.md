## Technologies

- .NET
- C#

## Architecture

This project follows the principles of DDD, Clean Architecture, and CQRS:

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: This approach focuses on the core domain and domain logic, uses a model-driven design, and emphasizes a collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a model of the domain problem at hand.
- **Clean Architecture**: This architecture aims to separate the software into layers, with a dependency rule that dependencies can only point inwards.
- **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**: This pattern separates reading and writing into different models, allowing the system to scale and evolve independently.
